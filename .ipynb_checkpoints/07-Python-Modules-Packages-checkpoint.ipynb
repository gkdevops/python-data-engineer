    "**1. Module: A Single Special LEGO Brick**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **What it is:** In Python, a **Module** is simply a single file containing Python code. This file has a `.py` extension (like `my_cool_functions.py`).\n",
    "*   **Think of it as:** A single, special LEGO brick that has a specific design and purpose. Maybe it's a cool window piece, or a special wheel.\n",
    "*   **Its job:** It groups related functions, classes (blueprints for objects), and variables together. For example, you might have a module called `text_helpers.py` that contains functions for cleaning up text, and another module `math_operations.py` for custom math calculations.\n",
    "*   **Why use it?**\n",
    "    *   **Keeps things tidy:** Instead of one giant LEGO castle (one giant Python file), you have organized sets of special bricks.\n",
    "    *   **Reusable:** You can use that \"wheel\" module in many different LEGO cars you build.\n",
    "*   **Example:**\n",
    "    If you have a file named `greetings.py`:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # greetings.py\n",
    "    def say_hello(name):\n",
    "        return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def say_goodbye(name):\n",
    "        return f\"Goodbye, {name}!\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Then `greetings.py` is a module. You can use it in another file like this:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # main_program.py\n",
    "    import greetings # Use the module\n",
    "\n",
    "    message = greetings.say_hello(\"Alice\")\n",
    "    print(message) # Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "**2. Package: A LEGO Set Box**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **What it is:** A **Package** is a collection of related modules organized in a directory (a folder). To Python, a directory becomes a package if it contains a special (often empty) file called `__init__.py`.\n",
    "*   **Think of it as:** A LEGO set box (like the \"Space Rocket\" set or the \"Police Station\" set). This box contains multiple bags of bricks (modules) that are all related to building that specific set. The `__init__.py` file is like the instruction manual's cover page, telling Python \"Hey, this folder is a package!\"\n",
    "*   **Its job:** It helps you organize a larger collection of related modules. For example, if you're building a big data analysis tool, you might have a package called `data_processing` which contains modules like `cleaning.py`, `validation.py`, and `transformation.py`.\n",
    "*   **Why use it?**\n",
    "    *   **Even more organization:** For bigger projects, just having separate modules isn't enough. Packages group modules that belong together.\n",
    "    *   **Avoids name clashes:** If you have a module `utils.py` in your `data_processing` package, and another developer has a `utils.py` in their `reporting` package, their names won't clash because they are in different \"boxes.\"\n",
    "*   **Example:**\n",
    "    Imagine this folder structure:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    my_project/\n",
    "    |-- main_program.py\n",
    "    |-- analytics_tools/      <-- This is our package\n",
    "        |-- __init__.py       <-- Makes 'analytics_tools' a package\n",
    "        |-- plotting.py       <-- A module in the package\n",
    "        |-- stats.py          <-- Another module in the package\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Inside `plotting.py`:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # analytics_tools/plotting.py\n",
    "    def create_bar_chart(data):\n",
    "        return \"Bar chart created!\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Inside `stats.py`:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # analytics_tools/stats.py\n",
    "    def calculate_mean(data):\n",
    "        return sum(data) / len(data)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    You can use it in `main_program.py` like this:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # main_program.py\n",
    "    from analytics_tools import plotting # Use a module from the package\n",
    "    import analytics_tools.stats     # Another way to use a module\n",
    "\n",
    "    chart = plotting.create_bar_chart([1,2,3])\n",
    "    print(chart) # Output: Bar chart created!\n",
    "\n",
    "    avg = analytics_tools.stats.calculate_mean([10, 20, 30])\n",
    "    print(avg) # Output: 20.0\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "**3. Library: A Big Collection of LEGO Sets (or a Specialized Toolkit)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **What it is:** A **Library** is a general term for a collection of packages and/or modules that provide a broad range of functionalities for a specific purpose. It's not a strict Python structural term like \"module\" or \"package,\" but more of a conceptual one.\n",
    "*   **Think of it as:**\n",
    "    *   A whole shelf in the toy store filled with many different LEGO set boxes (packages), all related to a theme like \"City Life\" or \"Space Exploration.\"\n",
    "    *   Or, think of it as a specialized toolkit, like a \"carpenter's toolkit\" or a \"data scientist's toolkit.\" It contains many tools (modules/packages) for doing specific types of jobs.\n",
    "*   **Its job:** To provide a ready-made set of tools so you don't have to build everything from scratch. For Data Engineers/Analysts, common libraries are:\n",
    "    *   **Pandas:** For working with tables of data (like spreadsheets).\n",
    "    *   **NumPy:** For numerical calculations, especially with arrays.\n",
    "    *   **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For creating charts and graphs.\n",
    "    *   **Requests:** For getting data from websites.\n",
    "    *   **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning.\n",
    "*   **Why use it?**\n",
    "    *   **Saves tons of time:** These libraries are written by experts and are well-tested.\n",
    "    *   **Powerful features:** They offer complex functionalities that would be very hard to code yourself.\n",
    "*   **How it relates:** A library (like Pandas) is typically distributed as one or more packages, which in turn contain many modules. When you `pip install pandas`, you're installing the Pandas library, which gives you access to its packages and modules.\n",
